My name is Kaela. I am a transfer student from Lane Community College, where the CIS 201-12 sequence is taught in C++ instead of Java.
Therefore, I am fairly confident when writing in C++ but I have no exposure to C. I also took a Linux/Unix class there but it was mainly meant for LCC's two year IT track. I took it because I wanted to get some exposure to Linux, but I didn't use what I learned and have forgotten most of it.
I'm really hoping that this class will get me more comfortable using Unix commands. While I don't remember much from the class I took, I do remember really enjoying learning how to do different things without the help of a GUI. There's something that really fascinates me about not having any of the "pretty little buttons", as my professor called them, to make things easy for me.
At the moment, I'm using OS X on a Mac, but I'd like to get to a point where I'm comfortable enough with Unix that I can do most, or all, of my work from an Arch Linux operating system.
I'm not really sure if the class will help me towards that goal, but I'm hoping that it will. Of course, I'm also looking forward to learning C since it is such an important language. I've heard that moving between C and C++ isn't too difficult, so I'm looking forward to seeing what that will be like.
Maybe what I want from this class is totally off base. I would not be surprised. I don't think I've had a single class in my college career that turned out to teach exactly what I wanted to learn. Can you tell I've run out of things to say? I hope you have a great day. Rhymes are cool.

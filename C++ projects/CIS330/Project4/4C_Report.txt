Report
	I noticed in my timings that with each successive increase of size led to a corresponding increase in the factor by which the time increased. For instance,
going from size 250 to 500 showed a 2.6 times increase in the time, but going from 500 to 1000 showed a 3.5 times increase in time. Going from 1000 to 2000 showed a
4.25 times increase in the time. I think that means that my program is exponential in time, but I'm honestly not really sure. I also noticed that executing the Red color
source image took longer than the Blue three out of four times, but have no explanation as to why that might be the case. The final thing I noticed was that execution of
the Blender execution took a little longer than the combination of the blue and red executions. This makes sense because I'm accessing a similar amount of information, but
doing a little more work on the data.
